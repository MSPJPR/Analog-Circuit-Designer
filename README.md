Objective

This project is a web-based Analog Circuit Designer & Analyzer that helps users visualize and analyze key amplifier parameters such as gain, bandwidth, voltage swing, power dissipation, and slew rate. It provides an interactive interface where users can adjust gain and bandwidth using sliders, and the system dynamically updates the circuit diagram and key performance metrics.

Features

1. User Interaction

Sliders for adjusting Gain (dB) and Bandwidth (MHz).

Real-time updates to display computed circuit characteristics.



2. Graphical Visualization

A dynamic circuit diagram that changes based on user input.

Circuit elements and signals are drawn on an HTML5 canvas.



3. Automatic Calculations

Computes Voltage Swing, Power Dissipation, and Slew Rate based on input values.



4. Enhanced UI & Mobile Responsiveness

CSS animations for smooth transitions.

Adaptive layout for different screen sizes.

Technologies Used

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Graphics: HTML5 Canvas API

How It Works

1. The user adjusts the gain and bandwidth sliders.


2. The JavaScript script computes the corresponding Voltage Swing, Power Dissipation, and Slew Rate values.


3. The circuit diagram updates dynamically to reflect the amplifierâ€™s behavior.


4. The UI remains smooth with animations and works efficiently on mobile devices.

This project provides a real-time analog circuit visualization tool that integrates both design and analysis, making it an excellent demonstration of applied electronics principles in a browser-based format.
